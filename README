Dynamic Employee Library
Overview: This project allows the User to make a list of Employees from many different data types including Vectors, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Binary Trees. It first prompts the User with a menu for them to make the list by using a while loop and asking for a specific number to be inputted. If they choose choice 1 they will start making a list of Employees which will prompt the User to enter the data for the Employee which includes their ssn, phone number, first name, and last name. Then adds that Employee to the end of the list. The second choice allows the user to print out the whole list by traversing through each element and printing their values. Then choice 3 will allow the user to add only one Employee to the end of the list. Choice 4 will allow the user to select an element to delete from their ssn and have a method to say if it was successfully deleted or if it was unable to delete the node. Choice 5 will search the list for a node that the user will be prompted to input by asking for the Employeeâ€™s ssn. It will then tell the user exactly which position the Employee is located. Choice 6 will allow the user to sort the list will many different algorithms. It first asks the user to input which algorithm they want to use first by entering a number. Then it will sort the list that is given. The algorithms included in this choice are bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, counting sort, quick sort, and merge sort. Lastly, the final choice is 7 allowing the user to exit the menu. Overall this project can be used to store, sort, delete, and search data using many different data algorithms.
